# IDChain
Our smart contract, named IDChain, is a decentralized solution that allows for secure and efficient verification of identities using blockchain technology. The contract utilizes a mapping function to store a record of registered users, and includes functions for registering users, requesting access, and transferring tokens named Cyrus the Great (CTG).

One of the key features of the contract is the verifyIdentity function, which allows for the verification of a user's identity using external data sources or off-chain methods. This could include a KYC service or check against a government ID database. Once a user's identity is verified, they are added to the mapping of registered users, and can then request access to a service or resource.

The contract also includes a checkAccess function, which allows for the checking of a user's permissions and access to a service or resource. This function could use external data sources or off-chain methods to determine a user's access level.

In addition to the core identity verification functionality, the contract also includes a token named Cyrus the Great (CTG), with a total supply of 136,166,949,700. This allows for the creation of a decentralized economy within the ecosystem, and allows for the transfer of tokens between users.

Overall, our smart contract provides a secure and efficient way for businesses and organizations to verify identities and manage access to services and resources. By utilizing blockchain technology, the contract is able to provide a transparent and immutable record of registered users and their access levels.
